## 📝 Problem Statement Name  
**Empowering Citizens of Uttar Pradesh: Bridging the Gap to Government Schemes and Financial Aid**

Millions of citizens in Uttar Pradesh remain unaware or confused about the schemes they’re eligible for—whether it’s scholarships, agricultural subsidies, startup support, or health benefits. The main challenge lies in accessibility, language barriers, and lack of personalized guidance.

This problem statement focuses on creating a smart, AI-driven solution that enables **easy discovery, understanding, and application of government schemes**—with special attention to the schemes offered by the **Government of Uttar Pradesh**. The goal is to empower people—especially from rural and semi-urban areas—by providing them with relevant information in their **local language**, matched to their **profile and needs**.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 🚀 Project Title  
**Seva: AI-Powered Multilingual Government Scheme Navigator**

**Seva** is an intelligent, multilingual virtual assistant designed to simplify access to government schemes—especially those offered by the **Government of Uttar Pradesh**. At its core, Seva integrates **IBM Watson Assistant** for powerful conversational capabilities, allowing users to interact naturally in **English, Hindi, and Bhojpuri**.

The frontend is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, providing an accessible and user-friendly interface where users can ask questions, get matched with relevant schemes, and receive step-by-step guidance on how to apply.

Whether it's a farmer looking for subsidies, a student in search of scholarships, or a woman entrepreneur seeking financial aid, **Seva** serves as a trustworthy digital guide—**breaking barriers of language, complexity, and awareness**.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 📘 Brief Project Description  

**Seva** is an AI-powered, multilingual chatbot platform developed to empower citizens—especially those in **rural and semi-rural areas**—to easily understand and access a wide range of government schemes and financial aid programs. From **students to senior citizens**, Seva is designed to serve **every age group** by simplifying complex government information into conversational, personalized guidance.

With support for **English, Hindi, and Bhojpuri**, Seva eliminates language barriers and reaches users in their native tongue—making it usable by farmers, daily wage earners, small business owners, students, homemakers, and retired individuals alike.

Seva intelligently recommends relevant schemes based on the user's **profile, age, income, occupation, location, caste category**, and more. Its AI engine combines:
- **IBM Watson Assistant** for contextual conversation and intent recognition,
- **OpenAI's LLM + LangChain** for natural language understanding and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),
- A structured knowledge base of **Uttar Pradesh government schemes**.

Built with a clean and intuitive **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend**, Seva provides a smooth user experience even for those with minimal digital literacy.

Whether it’s accessing education loans, pension plans, healthcare subsidies, startup funds, or women-focused initiatives, **Seva acts as a 24x7 digital guide**—bridging the **knowledge and accessibility gap** that often separates citizens from their rights and entitlements.

Seva isn't just a chatbot—it's a mission to make governance **inclusive, transparent, and citizen-centric**.
